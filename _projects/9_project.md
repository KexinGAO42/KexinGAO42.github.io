## About

This is a Kaggle Challenge ([Google â€“ AI Assistants for Data Tasks with Gemma](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-assistants-with-gemma))

The goal of this competition is to create a notebook that demonstrates how to use the Gemma LLM to accomplish one of the following data science oriented tasks:

1. Explain or teach basic data science concepts.
2. Answer common questions about the Python programming language.
3. Summarize Kaggle solution write-ups.
4. Explain or teach concepts from Kaggle competition solution write-ups.
5. Answer common questions about the Kaggle platform.

## Code

Code will be published soon!

## Current Progress

We are testing out Gemma's abilities to solve data task by asking it to do the competition ([Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data))
