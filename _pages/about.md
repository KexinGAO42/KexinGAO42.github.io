Welcome to my portfolio! I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computational Linguistics (CLMS) at the University of Washington in Seattle. My background spans AI/ML, UI/UX, product management, and linguistics.

I'm passionate about applying NLP and ML to real-world applications for human benefits. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Responsible AI, and Human-Centered Design. Let's explore how we can make a difference together.
