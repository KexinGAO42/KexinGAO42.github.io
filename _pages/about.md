Hello and welcome! I'm currently pursuing a Master's in [Computational Linguistics (CLMS)](https://www.compling.uw.edu/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA29auBhBxEiwAnKcSqlcj2RTvSsNeOyTujLnEqaIZt3VrxYMtidhJJWPCd-04tdZLKpqo9xoC85oQAvD_BwE) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle. Before that, I obtained my first Master's in Linguistics at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I have also worked as a Product Manager at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/).

My background spans linguistics, NLP, AI/ML, user experience and product management. I'm passionate about applying NLP and ML to real-world applications for human benefits. My interests include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Responsible AI, and Human-Centered Design. 

Let's explore how we can make a difference together!
